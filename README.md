# MSCI 446 Project: Predicting Player Transfer Values

This project was conducted as part of the MSCI 446 course requirement. We aimed to predict football player transfer values by scraping player statistics from the FBREF website and the Transfermarkt player value. The prediction models were built using clustering and supervised learning techniques, followed by data visualization for interpretation.
